  - context: The Local Projects Manual (LPM) is intended to assist non New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) transportation project sponsors in New York State who seek federal funding through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) , as well as state funding from New York State. The LPM aims to provide an overview of the processes, procedures, documentation, authorizations, approvals, and certifications required throughout the scoping, design, construction, and maintenance of transportation-related projects. While all attempts have been made to create a manual as comprehensive as possible, the dynamics of federal and state policy make it reasonable to expect that the reader will need to have other references at hand as well.
NYSDOT developed the procedures in cooperation with FHWA and representatives of the NYS County Highway Superintendents Association (NYSCHSA) and other external stakeholders. These organizations administer locally administered federal and state-aided transportation projects. Periodic updates are necessary to reflect changes in laws, rules, regulations, and executive orders, along with the institutional knowledge gained in the evolving practice of non NYSDOT administered federal and state aid transportation projects. Revision dates can typically be found in the footer of each chapter. The manual is intended to provide project development guidance to Sponsors, who are delegated most responsible for administering federal and state aid transportation projects. However, under U.S. Code Title 23, NYSDOT is ultimately responsible for federal aid transportation projects in New York State and cannot delegate its overall administrative duties, thereby retaining oversight authority. NYSDOT also retains ultimate responsibility for the successful implementation of non-
federal aid locally administered transportation projects in New York State.
