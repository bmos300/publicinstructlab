## NOTE

The web addresses referenced throughout this chapter (except LPM chapter links) can be found at the end of this chapter, in Section 1.8 References, Chapter 1 Introduction and Overview.

## 1.1  PURPOSE

The Local Projects Manual (LPM) is  intended to assist nonNew York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) transportation project sponsors in New York State who seek federal funding through the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) ,  as well as state funding from New  York  State.  The  LPM  aims  to  provide  an  overview  of  the  processes,  procedures, documentation,  authorizations,  approvals,  and  certifications  required  throughout  the  scoping, design, construction, and maintenance of transportation-related projects. While all attempts have been made to create a manual as comprehensive as possible, the dynamics of federal and state policy make it reasonable to expect that the reader will need to have other references at hand as well.

## 1.2 BACKGROUND

The procedures in this manual are compiled from numerous sources, including federal and state laws, rules, regulations, executive orders, guidelines, and operating practices, all of which must be followed to secure federal and state aid reimbursement. This manual has two other volumes, the Appendices , offering sample letters, fillable forms and other documentation, and the Internal Guidance , explaining processes internal to NYSDOT.

NYSDOT developed the procedures in cooperation with FHWA and representatives of the NYS County Highway Superintendents Association (NYSCHSA) and other external stakeholders. These  organizations  administer  locally  administered  federal  and  state-aided  transportation projects.  Periodic  updates  are  necessary  to  reflect  changes  in  laws,  rules,  regulations,  and executive orders, along with the institutional knowledge gained in the evolving practice of nonNYSDOT administered federal and state aid transportation projects. Revision dates can typically be found in the footer of each chapter.

The manual is intended to provide project development guidance to Sponsors, who are delegated most responsible for administering federal and state aid transportation projects. However, under U.S. Code Title 23 , NYSDOT is ultimately responsible for federal aid transportation projects in New York State and cannot delegate its overall administrative duties, thereby retaining oversight authority. NYSDOT also retains ultimate responsibility for the successful implementation of nonfederal aid locally administered transportation projects in New York State.

## 1.3  RELATED MANUALS

Other federal and state manuals and documents ,  noted in each chapter, will be referenced. These sources are typically indicated by in-text citations in bold and blue type. Links to the sources can be found at the end of each chapter in a References section.  The Regional Local Project Liaison (RLPL) is a crucial resource for locating relevant documents. The RLPL is the primary NYSDOT contact for all Sponsors. The RLPL should be consulted first when seeking information, clarification, or assistance while developing or delivering federally and state-funded transportation projects.  (For  an  expanded  description  of  the  role  of  RLPLs,  see Section  1.6,  Terms  and Definitions ).

## 1.4  MANUAL ORGANIZATION

This manual is divided into eighteen (18) chapters, some with associated appendices, and each describing a specific aspect of project development. Although not all projects will need to fulfill all portions of this manual to be successfully built and reimbursed, each chapter should be thoroughly reviewed by the Sponsor to determine whether the actions, activities, and decisions discussed apply to an individual project. (In the future, chapters may be added to reflect programs for other modes of transportation NYSDOT directly administers or otherwise oversees.)

## 1.4.1  Chapter Summaries

The  chapters  follow  the  typical  sequence  of  project  development  activities;  however,  some procedures can be performed concurrently, while others must be repeated for subsequent project phases. The following are summaries of the chapters:

Chapter 2: Roles and Responsibilities defines the duties of the various entities involved in project development and includes a table of activities and prerequisites for the entire federal aid process.

Chapter 3: Project Initiation, Management, and Funding provides an overview of the project development  process  to  properly  select  and  fund  a  federal  aid  project  and  obtain  project authorizations for each phase of a federally funded project. It also discusses the options available to the Sponsor for fulfilling its financial obligations to a project. Also discussed are current federal, and state programs available to fund local transportation projects.

Chapter 4: State-Local Agreements describes the contract between the Sponsor and NYSDOT necessary to obtain federal and applicable state aid reimbursement of eligible project costs. All locally  administered,  federal,  and  state  aid  transportation  projects  will  require  a  State-Local Agreement (SLA).

Chapter 5: Accounting and Reimbursement Procedures describes the general accounting procedures necessary to receive federal and applicable state aid reimbursement under an SLA. The chapter's appendices include forms, sample financial forms, and instructions that NYSDOT and the Sponsor will use in the accounting and billing process.

Chapter  6:  Consultant  Procurement  and  Administration describes  the  requirements  and methods for selecting, hiring, and managing consultants, including contract negotiations, contract execution, pre-award audit, and consultant contract close-out.

Chapter 7: Overview of the Environmental Process provides  an  overview  of  the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process and other federal and state environmental processes that  must  be  completed  before  utilizing  federal  or  state  aid  for  transportation  projects  and discusses procedures necessary to satisfy applicable environmental laws.

Chapter 8: Design Procedures focuses on the project scoping and design stages of the project development process, including public involvement requirements, which must be followed to bring a locally administered federal or state aid for transportation projects to the construction stage.

Chapter  9:  Design  Standards  and  Construction  Specifications describes  the  design standards  and  construction  specifications  used  in  the  contract  bid  documents  [Plans, Specifications, and Estimate (PS&E)].

Chapter 10: Railroads and Utilities describes the procedures used when a project involves a railroad or the relocation of utilities.  If  a  project  potentially  involves railroad  or  utility  property, facility, or operations, early contact with its owner is encouraged.

Chapter 11: Right of Way describes the procedures required to acquire Right-of-Way (ROW) for a  federal  or  state  aid  transportation  project.  The  procedures,  which  comply  with  the Uniform Relocation Assistance and Real Property Acquisition Policy Act, must be followed even if federal funds are not used to acquire ROW.

Chapter 12: Construction Contract Requirements describe the federal contract requirements to be included in federal aid transportation projects to ensure compliance; relevant appendices to Chapter 12 must be included in bid proposals.

Chapter  13:  Civil  Rights  Requirements guides  Sponsors  through  the  construction  and consultant contractual processes in a manner consistent with the USDOT rules and regulations governing Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 , Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 ,  and  the Americans  with  Disabilities  Act  of  1990 ,  the Disadvantaged  Business Enterprise (DBE) program and Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) .

Chapter 14: Advertisement, Contract Letting, and Award describes the process of advertising (soliciting  bidders),  letting  (bid  opening),  bid  analysis,  contract  award,  and  documentation  for locally administered federal-aid transportation construction contracts.

Chapter 15: Administer Construction Contracts covers the administration of federally funded, locally let construction contracts, including construction supervision, contract documentation, and construction contract close-out.

Chapter 16: Federal and State Single Audit Requirements discusses  compliance  with  the federal audit requirement provisions of 2 CFR 200 .  This chapter aims to advise the Sponsor's program manager, chief fiscal officer, and independent auditor.

Chapter 17: State-Local Agreement Close Outs describes the requirements for closing SLAs and submitting final reimbursement requests for a locally administered federal aid transportation project.

Chapter 18: Disaster Relief Programs and Procedures describes Federal Aid Programs, which provide emergency relief funding for transportation-related facilities damaged by natural disasters

or catastrophic failures from an external cause. The programs provide federal reimbursement to state and local transportation agencies to recoup the costs of repairing damage to facilities during disasters.

| De-obligation                           | The release of excess funds on previously active projects which are  currently  inactive.  If  additional  eligible  costs  are  identified,  a  modification can be made to reinstate funding. A State Transportation  Improvement Program (STIP) action may be required to re-establish  the project. Work undertaken while project funding is de-obligated is  not eligible for reimbursement with federal funds.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Design Approval Document  (DAD)         | A report documenting the condition, needs, objectives, and feasible  alternatives of a proposed project. The DAD is used to obtain FHWA,  NYSDOT, or Sponsor approval of a project and may also be used in  the solicitation of comments from other government agencies and the  local community.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Design-Build                            | A  method  of  delivering  a  project  in  which  design  and  construction  services are performed by a single contractor. Design-build provides a  single  point  of  responsibility  for  project  delivery,  thereby  simplifying  communication  and  minimizing  risks  for  the  project  owner  and  streamlining the delivery schedule. A design-build project can be led  by a contractor, a designer, a developer, or a joint venture, so long as  a  design-build  entity  holds  a  single  contract  for  both  design  and                                                                                                                                            |
| Design Hour Volume (DHV)                | The design  hourly  volume  (DHV)  is  usually  the  30th  highest  hourly  volume  for  the  design  year,  commonly  20  years  from  the  time  of  construction  completion.  For  situations  involving  high  seasonal  fluctuations in AADT, some adjustments of DHV may be appropriate.  In general, for two-lane rural highways, the DHV is the total traffic in  both directions of travel. On highways with more than two lanes (or on  two-lane  roads  where  important  intersections  are  encountered  or  where  additional  lanes  are  to  be  provided  later),  knowledge  of  the  directional distribution of traffic during the design hour is essential for |
| Design Phase(s)                         | NYSDOT divides the project development process into the following  four  stages:  Project  Initiation,  Project  Scoping,  Design,  and  Construction.  The  Design  Stage  is  further  broken  into  six  design  phases.  Phases 1 through 4 occur before Design Approval and are  also known collectively as the Preliminary Engineering Stage.

| Value Engineering (VE)                      | An independent engineering study of a project. A VE is completed by  licensed engineers who are not on the project team. The purpose of a  VE is to look for ways to: (1) provide needed design and construction  functions safely, reliably, efficiently and at the lowest overall cost; (2)  improve the value and quality of the project, and (3) reduce the time to  complete  the  project.  VE  is  federally  mandated  during  the  design  phase to explore best practices for all projects on the NHS valued at  greater  than  $50  million  for  highway  projects  and  greater  than  $40  million for bridge projects. FHWA may also require more than one VE  analysis to be performed on major projects with an estimated cost of  $500  million  or  more,  and  any  other  federal  aid  project  FHWA  determines  to  be  appropriate.  VE  can  also  be  proposed  by  the  contractor under Section 100 of the standard specification. |
